# Cloudflare Worker packager

Cloudflare workers and Front-end Application Bundles are a match made in heaven. Run your server-side logic in 160+ different datacenters around the world, close to your customers.

The Cloudflare packager will take a `fab.zip` and wrap the server-side component in a Cloudflare wrapper so it can be used there.
